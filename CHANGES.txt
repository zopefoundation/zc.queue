================

- Fixed undefined ZODB.POSException.StorageTransactionError in tests.

- Let tests pass with ZODB 3.8 and ZODB 3.9.

- Added test extra to declare test dependency on ``zope.testing``.

1.1
===

- Fixed a conflict resolution bug in CompositeQueue

- Renamed PersistentQueue to Queue, CompositePersistentQueue to
  CompositeQueue. The old names are nominally deprecated, although no
  warnings are generated and there are no current plans to eliminate
  them.  The PersistentQueue class has more conservative conflict
  resolution than it used to.  (The Queue class has the same conflict
  resolution as the PersistentQueue used to have.)
